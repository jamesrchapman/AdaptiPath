# AdaptiPath

AdaptiPath is an innovative approach that combines machine learning with the Wave Function Collapse (WFC) algorithm to adaptively trace paths and solve complex problems. By leveraging the flexibility and intelligence of adaptive WFC lambda functions, AdaptiPath aims to generate optimized paths that meet specific constraints and requirements.

## Features

- Adaptive WFC Lambda Functions: AdaptiPath utilizes machine learning techniques to adapt the lambda functions employed in the WFC algorithm, allowing for efficient path tracing and problem-solving.
- Path Generation: The project focuses on generating paths or solutions for a wide range of problem domains, including pattern generation, map creation, level design, and more.
- Customization: AdaptiPath provides flexibility for users to define problem specifications, constraints, and desired output criteria, enabling the generation of tailored paths.

## Usage

To use AdaptiPath, follow these steps:

1. **Install Dependencies**: Make sure you have the necessary dependencies installed. You can find the required packages listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

2. **Data Collection**: Gather a dataset of input-output pairs that capture the problem specifications and corresponding desired paths or solutions. This dataset will be used to train the machine learning model.

3. **Model Training**: Train the machine learning model using the collected dataset. The model learns to map the problem specifications to the adapted lambda functions.

4. **Adaptation**: For a new problem specification, use the trained model to predict the adapted lambda functions that suit the problem requirements.

5. **Integrate with WFC Algorithm**: Incorporate the adapted lambda functions into the WFC algorithm for path tracing. Implement the necessary steps to update the lambda functions based on the adapted values.

6. **Evaluation and Refinement**: Evaluate the performance of the adapted lambda functions by comparing the generated paths against desired outcomes. Refine the model or collect additional data as needed to improve the results.
